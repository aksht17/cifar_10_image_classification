# cifar_10_image_classification
**Project Type**: Self-Project   

---

#### Objective  
 Built a CNN-based Image Classification Model to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 object categories.
---

#### Approach  
- Utilized the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset and normalized RGB image pixel values for multi-class classification.
- Built CNN with stacked Conv2D, ReLU activation & MaxPooling layers for hierarchical feature extraction.
- Trained the model for 30 epochs using Adam Optimizer & categorical cross-entropy, monitoring accuracy & loss.
---

#### Result
- Achieved 80.69% test accuracy, 85.18% training accuracy, and 81.08% validation accuracy on the Model.
- Achieved low test loss of 0.6228, indicating strong classification on test data & effective feature learning.
- Maintained minimal gap between training loss(0.4231) and validation loss(0.5720), indicating low overfitting.
